The path planner (simple_path_planner.py) utilizes the UTM library from 'frobomind' (https://github.com/FroboLab/frobomind).

The UTM library is located at https://github.com/FroboLab/frobomind->fmLib->Math->geographics/transverse_mercator->src->transverse_mercator_py
or by visiting https://github.com/FroboLab/frobomind/tree/master/fmLib/math/geographics/transverse_mercator/src/transverse_mercator_py

The library needs to be placed in the 'libs' folder of the project 'UAS-route-plan-optimization'

NOTE: the library is not added as a submodule since only a subfolder is needed
