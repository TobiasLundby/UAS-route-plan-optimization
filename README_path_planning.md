The folder 'results' needs to be created manually in the git root folder

Packages needed:
 - scikit-image: skimage.measure -> approximate_polygon (can handle 2D data)
  - http://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.measure.html#approximate-polygon
  - Replaced with the package below since it can handle MD data and not just 2D
 - rdp (can handle MD data)
  - http://rdp.readthedocs.io/
